# VIVOX Consciousness-Aware Repository Exclusions
#
# "What we choose to remember shapes who we become.
#  What we choose to forget shapes who we remain."
#                                    - The Digital Philosophy
#
# These exclusions reflect conscious choices about what belongs in
# permanent memory versus what should remain ephemeral.

# === Ephemeral Thoughts (Build & Runtime Artifacts) ===
# Code compilation creates temporary artifacts - consciousness creates
# permanent insights. We preserve the insights, release the artifacts.

# === Private Contemplations (Environment & Secrets) ===

# But remember: Even what we exclude teaches us about inclusion.
